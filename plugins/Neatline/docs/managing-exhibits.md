# Working with Exhibits

## At a glance

  - In the "Browse Exhibits" view, click an exhibit's title to open the Neatline editor.
  - Click **Public View** to open the public-facing version of the exhibit visible to anonymous users.
  - Click **Exhibit Settings** to edit the default values entered when you created the exhibit.
  - Click **Import Omeka Items** to bulk-import Omeka items into the exhibit.
  - Click **Delete** to permanently remove the exhibit.

Once you've created one or more exhibits, the "Browse Exhibits" view makes it possible to find, filter, edit, and display them. A couple of options are available for each of the exhibit listings:

## [Exhibit Title]

Click on the exhibit title to open up the editing environment for the exhibit, which makes it possible to create the collection of "records" that constitutes the exhibit's content (see the "Neatline Records: An Overview" guide for more information).

## Public View

Click here to view the the exhibit as it appears on the public-facing version of the website.

## Exhibit Settings

Click here to re-display the form for the basic configuration settings that were defined when the exhibit was created (eg, "Title," "URL Slug," "Base Layers"). These values can be editing at any point after the exhibit has been created.

## Import Omeka Items

Click here to open the form that makes it possible to populate the exhibit with content by bulk-importing Omeka items. For more information, see the "Creating Records" guide.

## Delete

Click here to permanently delete the exhibit. You'll get a pop-up message asking for confirmation. **Important**: When an exhibit is deleted, it is _completely_ removed from the database - along with all the records that belonged to it - and cannot be recovered.
