# Editing Record Opacities

## At a glance

  - Opacities are stored as 3-digit decimal values between 0.00 (completely translucent) and 1.00 (completely opaque).
  - To change an opacity value, you can type directly into the field.
  - Or you can click on the field and drag up or down on the page, causing the value to change smoothly.
  - As an opacity is changed, the new value will be automatically previewed on the map.

### Examples:

  - `0.00`
  - `1.00`
  - `0.56`
